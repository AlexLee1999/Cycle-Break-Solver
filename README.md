# Cycle Break Solver

## Introduction
The main task of the program is to detect the cycles in the given graph, and break the cycle with minimum cost.  
There are two kinds of graph
- Undirected Graph
- Directed Graph

## Undirected Graph
The optimal solution is use the Maximum Spanning tree. 
In this program, the program uses Prim's algorithm with binary heap.

## Directed Graph
